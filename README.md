### 🔍 Main Functions

- **`startGame()`**: Initializes the game with "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors" buttons, prompting the player to choose.
- **`endGame(event)`**: Triggered by a player's choice, this function calculates the result based on the player’s and computer's moves and displays it.
- **`calcResult(move1, move2)`**: Compares the player’s and computer’s moves to determine if it’s a win, loss, or tie.
- **`randomMove()`**: Generates a random number between 0 and 2 to simulate the computer's move.
